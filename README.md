# Password-Generator-in-Python
Declare a string of integers + uppercase + lowercase + special characters in Python code to generate a password. Take a random sample of the string of the given length:

```
enter the length of password  10
aS7hRV1/*o
```

In the above code, I first loaded the random module into Python, and then I asked for user input on the password length. Then I saved the letters, numbers, and special characters that I wanted to use when creating a password. Then I do a random sampling by merging the password length and the variable s, which results in a random password.
